<p><b>"pyreading.py"</b> involves reading a JavaScript file and printing a report in a .txt file. The report includes how many lines of code
there are, how many "else" statements and how many characters there are in total.</p>

<p><b>"pydirectory.py"</b> reads each file and their size (in kb) in the current directory and prints how many files there are with 
the total amount of the file sizes</p>

<p><b>"pycitycensus.py"</b> This was the first introduction to working with data using Calgary's "Census By Community 2018".
It totals the "res_cnt" by "CLASS" and "SECTOR". Then it counts the number of lines in the data, and prints a report in a ".txt" file
with those numbers.
